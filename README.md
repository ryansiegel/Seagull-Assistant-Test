NOTICE: This is a live repository that when updated will push a deployment to the bot. Be careful when updating things inside this repository.

THIS IS THE TEST BOT & NOT THE PRODUCTION BOT - A Pokemon Go discord bot helper. The main purpose is to help tournament staff host tournaments with as many resources at their fingertips as possible while also being a resource for those in the tournament. The bot also has other things like it keeps track of local nests for a community, handles reminders for different items, and more.
